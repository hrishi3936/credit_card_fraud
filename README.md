Credit card fraud is a type of financial crime where someone steals your credit card information or uses your card to make unauthorized purchases. It can occur in a number of ways, including: 
Stolen cards: Someone steals your physical credit card. 
Stolen information: Someone steals your credit card information through phishing, skimming, or data breaches. 
Clone cards: Someone uses your stolen account information to create a "clone" card. 
New accounts: Someone opens a new account using your personal information. 
To protect yourself from credit card fraud, you can: 
Keep your card with you and never share it with anyone. 
Never share your credit card number or one-time password (OTP) with anyone, even if they claim to be from your bank. 
Monitor your bank account statements for suspicious activity. 
Banks and financial institutions offer credit card protection plans that can help protect you from fraud. These plans often include a 24-hour helpline and zero liability if you report fraud within a certain time frame.
